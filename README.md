# SDX Breath Monitoring App
App made for patients to practice breathing for the SDX breath monitoring system, which is used to help treat cancer. In person practice is costly and now with greater risk to elderly paitents due to COVID-19, this app allows for the user to practice the treatment process safely at home which reduces cost and the number of visits greatly.

## Getting Started
This is a simple JavaScript app that takes keyboard input. It can be tested by opening the file location in the browser.

## Usage
This app is being used by Dr. Peng Wang, Chief Proton Physicist at INOVA.

## Future Improvements
Currently focusing on making the interface more sleek, but still match the visual requirements of the actual treatment process.
